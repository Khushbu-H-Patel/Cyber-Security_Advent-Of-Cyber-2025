# IDOR - Santa’s Little IDOR

This room focuses on lDOR vulnerability, how to identify it, how to mitigate. Also the concept of authentication and authorization is touched. It also explains that IDOR cannot be hide by using hashing or encoding as it can also be predicted and broken.

IDOR stands for Insecure Direct Object Reference. It is a critical web security vulnerability where an application exposes the internal object identifier in the URL or parameters that they should not such as user IDs. Which allows attackers to manipulate or access these values bypassing the authorization control.
