# XSS - Merry XSSMas

This room focuses on how cross sit scripting (XSS) works and how to prevent XSS attack.

Cross site scripting: XSS lets attackers inject malicious Java Script in to a website and when the browser does not sanitize the user input properly, the browser treats that input as a code that leads to session cookies, redirecting users, fake login popup etc…

## Types of XSS:
### 1. Reflected XSS:
It’s what happens when the app takes the user input and reflects it straight back to you. It’s an immediate response.
### 2. Stored XSS: 
The payload gets saved on the server and whenever that page has been visited; it triggers. It’s more dangerous than reflected.
