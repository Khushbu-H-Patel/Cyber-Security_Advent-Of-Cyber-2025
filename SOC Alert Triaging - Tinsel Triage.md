# SOC Alert Triaging - Tinsel Triage

This room talks about the Microsoft Sentinel which is cloud-native SIEM and SOAR platform to review and analyse alerts. 

There are four factors which represents the essential dimensions of triage:
1.	Severity: How bad? How bad is it?
2.	Time: When? How urgent is it?
3.	Context: Where in the attack life cycle? What do I handle first?
4.	Impact: Who or what is affected? What does it impact?
