# Obfuscation - The Egg Shell File

This room talks about obfuscation, why and where it’s used, different techniques and difference between encoding, encryption and obfuscation.

Obfuscation is the technique of deliberately making code, data, or communications complex and unintelligible to hide their true purpose. Attackers is it to evade basic detection and delay investigation. Encryption is used to achieve confidentiality. Encoding is used to represent data in different format.

**Layered Obfuscation:** Attackers use one method to obfuscate and then use another method to obfuscate already obfuscate data which makes to much more harder for the defense team to de-obfuscate and identify the exact pattern.
